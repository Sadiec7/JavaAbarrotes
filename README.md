# **Grocery Store Management System - Java (OOP Project)**  

This is a **Java-based grocery store project** designed to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The system utilizes **classes and arrays** to simulate a **functional mini-system** that allows users to:  

âœ… **Generate invoices**  
âœ… **Perform CRUD operations** on customers and products  
âœ… **Showcase key OOP concepts** such as **inheritance** and **class instantiation**  

The project was developed using **NetBeans**, making it an excellent example for those learning **OOP in Java**. It provides hands-on experience with **real-world programming techniques** while maintaining simplicity through the use of arrays as a basic **database substitute**.

## **Key Features**  
- **Invoice Generation:** Simulates real-life transactions by generating invoices based on selected products and customers.  
- **CRUD Operations:** Allows adding, updating, deleting, and listing customers and products.  
- **OOP Principles:** Implements **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, and **polymorphism** effectively.  
- **NetBeans Integration:** Built and tested using the **NetBeans IDE** for an efficient development experience.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Java (OOP-based)**  
- **NetBeans IDE**  
- **Arrays as a Database Substitute**  

This project is an **ideal reference for beginners** looking to understand how **OOP can be applied in real-world applications** using **Java**. ðŸš€
